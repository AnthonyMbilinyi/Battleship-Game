# Battleship Game Rules and Gameplay

## Introduction
The **Battleship Game** is a two-player strategy game where players take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's ships on a hidden grid. The objective is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

This version of the game is played in a console-based environment. The following rules explain the gameplay mechanics and how to interact with the game.

## Game Setup
1. **Grid Dimensions**: 
   - Each player has a grid (usually 10x10, but this can vary).
   - The grid is labeled with letters (rows) and numbers (columns), e.g., `A1`, `B3`, etc.

2. **Ships**:
   - Each player has a predefined fleet of ships. Common ship types include:
     - **Carrier** (5 cells)
     - **Battleship** (4 cells)
     - **Cruiser** (3 cells)
     - **Submarine** (3 cells)
     - **Destroyer** (2 cells)
   - Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically, but they cannot overlap or extend beyond the grid.

3. **Ship Placement**:
   - Players place their ships on their grid either manually or randomly (depending on the implementation).
   - The placement is hidden from the opponent.

## Gameplay
1. **Turn Structure**:
   - Players take turns firing shots to guess the location of their opponent’s ships.
   - A shot is specified by entering a coordinate (e.g., `B4`).

2. **Shot Outcomes**:
   - **Hit**: If the coordinate contains part of a ship, it is marked as a hit.
   - **Miss**: If the coordinate does not contain any ship, it is marked as a miss.
   - **Sunk**: If all parts of a ship are hit, the ship is sunk, and the player is notified.

3. **Marking the Grid**:
   - The attacking player’s grid marks hits, misses, and sunk ships to track progress.
   - The defending player’s grid updates the status of their ships as they take damage.

## Winning the Game
- The game ends when one player successfully sinks all of the opponent’s ships.
- The player who sinks all the opponent's ships first is declared the winner.

---

## Additional Rules
1. **Invalid Moves**:
   - Players cannot fire at the same coordinate more than once. If attempted, they will be prompted to choose a different coordinate.

2. **Time Limits (Optional)**:
   - To keep the game moving, players may have a time limit to make each move.

3. **Fog of War**:
   - Players cannot see the opponent’s grid or ship placements, maintaining the element of strategy and surprise.

## How to Play
1. Run the program in your terminal or console.
2. Follow on-screen instructions to place your ships and start the game.
3. Take turns guessing the opponent's ship locations until one player wins.

Feel free to customize these rules further or adapt them based on the specific features of your game. If your implementation includes additional features like AI opponents, customizable grids, or special weapons, consider adding those to the documentation as well.
