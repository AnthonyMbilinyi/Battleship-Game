Battleship: Console-Based Game (C++)
Overview
This repository contains a console-based implementation of the classic Battleship game, developed in C++. The game allows players to place ships on a grid and take turns guessing the opponent's ship locations. It is designed to provide an engaging and strategic experience entirely within the terminal.

Features
Single-player Mode: Play against an AI opponent.
Two-player Mode: Play with a friend on the same system.
Customizable Grid Size: Modify the grid dimensions for a unique experience.
Random or Manual Ship Placement: Players can place ships manually or opt for randomized placement.
Interactive Gameplay: Visual feedback for hits, misses, and sunk ships.
Simple and Lightweight: A minimalist approach, playable on any system with a C++ compiler.
Game Rules
Objective: The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.
Grid and Ships:
Each player has their own grid (default size: 10x10).
Ships vary in size:
Carrier (5 cells)
Battleship (4 cells)
Cruiser (3 cells)
Submarine (3 cells)
Destroyer (2 cells)
Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically but cannot overlap.
Gameplay:
Players take turns firing shots by entering coordinates (e.g., A3).
Each shot results in a hit, miss, or sunk ship.
The game continues until one player's fleet is entirely destroyed.
How to Play
Compile the Game:
Use a C++ compiler to build the program:
g++ -o battleship battleship.cpp
Run the executable:
./battleship
Game Setup:
Choose single-player or two-player mode.
Place your ships on the grid manually or select random placement.
Taking Turns:
Enter the coordinates of your shot during your turn.
The game will display the result of your shot and update the grid.
Win Condition:
The first player to sink all of the opponent's ships wins the game.
Code Structure
Main Game Logic: Handles turn-based gameplay, input/output, and result processing.
Grid Class: Manages the player's grid and ship placement.
Ship Class: Defines ship properties like size, position, and status.
AI Logic (Optional): Implements decision-making for single-player mode.
Future Enhancements (Optional)
Add a scoring system to track performance across games.
Implement a difficulty setting for the AI opponent.
Introduce special weapons like torpedoes or radar scans.
Add a save/load feature for game progress.
